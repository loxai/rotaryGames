Sooo, here's a tiny fun project I've been working on casually: a collection of mini games for the m5stickC.
The m5stick is a nice esp32 package, inexpensive and with plenty of features, great for DIYing IoT projects and such.
I realised the exposed gpio fits a rotary encoder nicely (best to desolder the encoder header and resolder on the opposite side), so went ahead and turned it into a 'miniconsole'.
I have no experience in C/C++, the code is a bit messy and inelegant... I just wanted to make some simple games :p
